# Tangle EE Workding Group - General

Build, Innovate And Collaborate On Decentralized Ledger Technology
The Tangle EE working group is comprised of various projects. Each project explores a particular use case on IOTA.

Together with our commercial and academic partners, we provide thought-leadership and develop libraries, applications, documentation, and examples that allow our ecosystem to build innovative solutions with the Tangle.

All projects are governed by Eclipse and are open-source by default.
