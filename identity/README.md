# Tangle EE Workding Group - Tangle Identity

The Tangle Identity project consists of several components including a high-level implementation of the UIP core, examples and documentation. Any Self Sovereign Identity project can only become a success as code solutions become possible, alongside a strong effort for adoption. The toolkit lowers the barrier-to-entry and fosters adoption. An initial whitepaper about the subject of SSI and a Unified Identity solution can be found here. 

In scope:

Development of the code for Tangle Identity 
- Develop a high-level protocol
- Create tutorials and code samples
- Develop tools and applications

Educate and experiment through the publication of thought leadership
- Write whitepaper(s) to compliment code
- Explore specific cases per industry
