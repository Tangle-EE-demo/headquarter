# Tangle EE Workding Group - Tangle Marketplaces


## Background
IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger built with the Internet of Things in mind. It can be leveraged for a number of purposes, including feeless microtransactions and messaging with data integrity.

## Scope
Tangle Marketplaces provides a toolkit to support the development of industry and problem-specific decentralized marketplaces on IOTA. 

The IOTA client libraries (e.g. https://docs.iota.org/) and node software (e.g. https://github.com/iotaledger/iri) are out of scope for this project.

## Description
This project provides a foundation for developers to build decentralized marketplaces on the IOTA network, allowing them to prototype concepts and explore new decentralized business models. Tangle Marketplaces is a starting point for developing decentralized marketplaces on the IOTA network. Different programming languages can be used as long as there is a corresponding IOTA client library available.
